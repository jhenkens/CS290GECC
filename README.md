ECC Library for CS290G
For @syassami and @jhenkens 's CS290G final project.
In order for proper function, make sure that you clone to a directory that does not have spaces in its absolute path.
This is not my bug (as far as I know), but an XCode bug, where the header search path wont work if $(SRC_ROOT) contains spaces.
